# MINIMUM DETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATON
Implementation of a DFA in C++. It is a finite-state machine that accepts and rejects strings 
of symbols and only produces a unique computation of the automaton for each input string.

The program can read, show, minimize and export a DFA. Besides it can show the dead states and analyze a
string to see if it belongs to the DFA.

## Usage
To start the program first you have to compile the source with MakeFile. After that you can start it executing:

```
.bin/dfa
```
Once the program is started it will show a menu with 6 options:

    ⬤ Option 0: Exit
    ⬤ Option 1: Read DFA 
    ⬤ Option 2: Show DFA
    ⬤ Option 3: Show death states
    ⬤ Option 4: Analyze string
    ⬤ Option 5: Minimize DFA
    ⬤ Option 6: Export DFA
    
Finally in the test folder there is an example of DFA syntax.
